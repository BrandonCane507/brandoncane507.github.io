Welcome to my website! Im not totally sure what I will post here, but it will have my research, astrophotography, and projects for my current class. Ideally I would add things that intrest me as well, and I think would be fun. However, I am not even sure where this post will end up so I have a lot of work ahead of me.
Some things I am currently trying to work on, is getting my favicon to work, and my website not breaking if you click on anything.
