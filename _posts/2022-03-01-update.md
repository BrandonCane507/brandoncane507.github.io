In my last post, I talked about how my website was still under serious construction. During my free time I was able
to fix the website. All the links work! I thought I would use this space share where I got my [favico](https://icons8.com/). They have a ton of awesome favicos and that made it hard to pick one haha. Thinking about how I might change it, I feel the orange does not really match with the green theme.
Now that I have all the links working, I will start filling each page out. I am not sure what I want to do with the home page, though. I think I might use it as a space to share things I find interesting.
