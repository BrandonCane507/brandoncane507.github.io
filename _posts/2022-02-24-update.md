In my last post, I talked about how my website was still under serious construction. During my free time I was able
to fix a lot of the website. All of the links work, besides my home button lol. I thought I would use to share where I got my [favico](https://icons8.com/). They have a ton of awesome favicos and that made it hard to pick one haha. Maybe I will change it soon.
Now that I have all the links working besides home, I wil slowly start filling in each page. Hopefully I figure out how to fix the home button too.
