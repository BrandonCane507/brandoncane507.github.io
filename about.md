 Howdy, I am Brandon! I am a senior undergraduate Physics and Astronomy major at the University of Pittsburgh. During my time at Pitt, I worked with Prof. Arthur Kosowsky and Dr. Yilun Guan. I have also worked  on an undergraduate research group called STEPUP, Survey of Transiting Extrasolar Planets at the University of Pittsburgh. My research interests include cosmic microwave background (CMB) data analysis, I worked with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration to utilize machine learning to determine if the data collected is usable for the CMB maps or if the detectors on the telescope malfunctioned. Outside of school, I can be found in my kitchen cooking, baking or in the gym. You might also see me walking around on a nice day. </p>
