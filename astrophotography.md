My most recent work is of Andromeda, also known as M31, taken on December 21st, 2020. It is the closest galaxy to our own, and in a couple billion years it will collide with us. I took this image with my friend, Luke. He is currently writing a magazine article on the process of taking such an image, and when it is down, I will post it for anyone that is curious about all the work that goes into one image. You might be thinking “Isn't M31 a spiral galaxy, why is it red and not blue?” Well, that is a good question and Luke, and it is because the DLSR camera we use has a hydrogen alpha sensitivity. This translates to a redder image.
