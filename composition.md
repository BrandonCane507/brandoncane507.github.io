For my first assignment in my composing digital media class, I had to make a <a href="Date Night (real).html"> twine game</a>. For the game, I decided to make a dating game, so the idea is you go on a first date and get to choose what to say. My favorite part about the game is the some of the choices come from real dates my friends or I have experienced. Can you figure out what is real?
