For my first assignment in my composing digital media class, I had to make a twine game. For the game, I decided to make a dating game, so the idea is you go on a first date and get to choose what to say. My favorite part about the game is the some of the choices come from real dates my friends or I have experienced. Can you figure out what is real?

For my newest project I had to create a imaginary app. I love spending time on my phone, perhaps too much. This led me to think of an app called DayTime Savior. It prohibits how much your phone can be charged depending on phone usage.

For my last project, I made a video of making sourdough.
